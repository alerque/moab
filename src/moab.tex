\title{Memoirs of a Bulletin}
\subtitle{The Long Road to Typeset Liturgies Made Straight}

\begin{abstract}

As long as today is called "today"\footnote{Hebrews 3:13}, Sunday will still
come every Sunday~\dots~but typesetting the bulletin doesn't have to be a
chore\footnote{Leviticus 23:3}, nor do the results have to be an eyesore. Even
for non-graphically-inclined people like myself there are ways to make the
process of producing well-typeset documents a relatively painless process.

While the resulting system is painless, discovering these techniques and
applying them to the making of bulletins was not that easy for me. I write this
article to document my own findings in hopes that it will make the same journey
easier for any that would follow.

\end{abstract}

\section*{Prologue}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Prologue}

For all his immense love of books, the pastor I work with doesn't really
understand what properties transform text into effective communication. His
version of 'typesetting' is to underline everything, then bold a few things that
got lost in the lines.\footnote{To his credit he refrains from the
	five-fonts-on-one-page routine, but I have seen five sizes.} We don't
have a church secretary. That leaves me---a programmer not a
designer---typesetting most of what we produce as a church. While this is less
than ideal, I found there are tools that make the job easier.

When I started down the road of typesetting our bulletins using \LaTeX, I was
unable to find much helpful documentation out there. \LaTeX itself is
extensively documented, but few of the examples available are applicable to the
special needs of bulletins. The system excels at books and articles, but needs
some extra love to produce smaller scale work with more formatting that content.
I found a few others online doing roughly the same thing, but for fear of this
reading like a hall of shame I will refrain from naming most of the
names\footnote{One entry went so far as to align footers on each page by
	inserting fixed-height boxes in the body after the page content that had
	been carefully measured to push the remainder to roughly the bottom of
	each page!}.  Most samples used booklet formatting that limited you to a
pre-defined number of pages.\footnote{Having that special service where your
	liturgy runs over a page shouldn't destroy your publishing process; nor
	should you have to remember that pages 1, 2, 3, and 4 of your document
	are actually 4, 1, 2, and 3 respectively when printed.}

The system I outline in the following pages will not work for all churches. In
fact the contents, layout and usage of their bulletin is a tell: its bulletin
will tell you a lot about the church because it reflects in large part their
theology of worship. You will find a good deal of mine in the pages and some of
the techniques will be more or less useful to you depending on your church's
understanding of liturgy. I will make no apology for my own, how you adapt this
is your business.

\section{Why not just use a word processor?}

\index{Word}
Why Microsoft Word is not the tool for the job.

\index{LibreOffice}
My weapon of choice would be LibreOffice, but this didn't get me much further.

Why alternatives like page layout programs don't quite cut the mustard.

Bad bad typography.

If you think the example on the left is better that the right, stop reading now
and walk away.

(bad example figure) (good example figure)

Special events shouldn't require starting from scratch with a totally new
layout. Memorial services, weddings, seminars, etc should be easily adaptable
from existing publishing workflow.

You shouldn't be copy-pasting a bunch of repetitive parts or trying to remember
what week you used that special thing...

\section{What is the right tool for the job?}

Have more than a hammer.

Use real typesetting tools.

\index{InDesign}\index{Quark Express}
InDesign, Quark

\index{Linux}
Most are not free, not portable, won't run on Linux, produce output that is not
maintainable.

\subsection{Why \LaTeX?}

Simple. Versatile. Accurate. Readable. Consistent.

Portable output. (booklet, full page, pdf, ebook, web)

\subsubsection{But won't \LaTeX be bad for my health?}

There are a couple pitfalls to be aware of.

\subparagraph{Your congregation might get the wrong idea.}

When they hear you are using something called 'latex' and plug that search term
into Google all by itself, it's probable that what comes up first will be NSW
and certainly not safe for the church office. It's unfortunate that the name
should be hijacked by a fetish, but once you start searching for \texttt{latex +
	<anything document related>} the problem pretty much goes away.

\subparagraph{You can't set this up on a Sunday morning.}

The initial setup is a little complicated to setup. You can't do this at the
last minute, you will need to prepare your system in advance. Do this on a week
where you have some extra time and think about how to handle you special
services \emph{before} they happen rather that when you are already swamped
getting ready for them.

Your secretary might actually \emph{never} end up like it. Good semantic
document structure is inherently limiting. This can be a good thing, but it will
feel like a loss of freedom to some.\footnote{Gratuitous parallel to how freedom
	in Christ is limiting to our lifestyle but the result being for our
	good.}

\subsection{Are there other alternatives?}

There really aren't other viable alternatives in this class. Unless you want to
hand code generating PDF's from code of your own\footnote{This is actually not
	\emph{that} hard to do and is what I started to do before realizing that
	\LaTeX was a better tool for the job. The disadvantage is that tweaking
	your layout to match your ever changing content is complex and not
	something the church secretary is going to pull off. Good typesetting
	rather that just filling in a few blanks quickly gets too cumbersome and
	I gave up this route.} Your only other choice is to use a page layout
tool. Quark Express used to be the old standby for church use, but InDesign is
the popular kid on the block in this space today.

\section{Where do I start?}

\subsection{How do I install the tools?}

texlive, mactex, <windows>?

texmaxer

lilypond

git

\subsection{How do I make it do something?}

\begin{ExampleFile}[helloworld.tex]
\documentclass{letter}
\begin{document}
Hello world!
\end{document}
\end{ExampleFile}

See example~\vref{helloworld.tex}

\subsection{How do I use the examples in this tutorial?}

All the sample files and tools mentioned in this tutorial are available at
Github\footnote{\url{https://github.com/alerque/moab}}. You may browse and download them
individually from there, but there is a better way.

Clone the whole repo...

Or if you would like to contribute your changes back to this project, start by
using the "Fork" link at the top right of the Github page.

\section{What is the essence of a bulletin?}

We covered this already in example~\vref{helloworld.tex}.

In which I rant against church services being about entertainment.

The bulletin should be useful but not take front stage. It should be readable,
communicate it's message and get out of the way.

\subsection{Rounding up the usual suspects}

Think carefully about what you may need to include, consider \emph{not}
including some things you might normally think of as par-for-the-course.

Church info

announcements

\subsection{Liturgical styles}

What you include may vary and have unique formatting requirements.

Responsive readings.

Creeds.

\subsection{Coordinating other media types}

Interfacing with content used elsewhere (web, projection, mobile)

\section{All the things you can do}

\subsection{Headers and footers}

Using the sparingly, they will make printing different layouts harder.

fancyhdr vs scrpage2

\subsection{Debugging your layout}

\index{Debuging}
Figuring out \emph{why} something is the way it is in a rendered \LaTeX~document
is not that easy, but there are a few tricks you can use.

\index{\verb+\usepackage{showframe}+}
As you begin your initial layout and are trying to understand the basic page
formatting  rules, it can be helpful to see where the page margigns are. You can
de this by enabling the \texttt{showframe} package as in
example~\vref{showframe}.

\begin{wrapfigure}[5]{r}{0.5\textwidth}
	test
\end{wrapfigure}

\begin{ExampleCode}[showframe]
\usepackage{showframe}
\end{ExampleCode}

\section{Putting it all together}

Bring alll the bits from the previous section

\subsection{A working template}

%\verbatiminput{/home/caleb/projects/ipk_belgeler/toplanti/deneme.tex}

\subsection{Beam me up Scotty! (compile time considerations)}

Why multi-pass is necessary.

\index{Arara}
Arara.

\section{But how do I print it?}

Not by reaching for File » Print from your text editor!

You generate finished documents (usually in PDF format).

\subsection{Booklet printing}
\index{Booklet}

\subsubsection{The easy way with pdf}

\section{How do I organize all this stuff?}

Whether alone or not, managing files that collect over time...

\subsection{The hard way(s)}

\subsection{The right way: version control}

\subsubsection{VCS Systems}

\index{VCS}\index{DVCS}\index{Subversion}

Distributed vs dumb.

\subsection{GIT magic}
\index{Git}

In which the use of \texttt{git} is explained in relation to Bulletin
management.

\begin{verbatim}
# git init
\end{verbatim}

\section{Advanced wizardry}

\subsection{A better tomorrow, made possible by macros}
\index{Macros}

How to write custom commands for oft-repeated tasks.

\subsection{Using external files}


\subsubsection{Sourcing liturgical bits}

Keeping your creeds, responsive readings, etc. in separate files.

Including other content such as sermon outlines that is also published
separately.

\subsubsection{Backfill}

\index{Backfill}

This is tricky from paul \cite{backfill}

\subsubsection{Pulling data from external API's}

Auto importing verse data from the web.

\subsection{Is that a song I hear?}
\index{Music}

Why including music in the bulletin can be good for worship.

\subsubsection{Lilypond to the rescue}
\index{Lilypond}

\subsection{Language considerations}
\index{Language}

Every tongue.

\subsubsection{Using different encodings}

\subsubsection{Multi-lingual output}

Examples of parallel typeset content in two languages.

Or make two print editions with different content from the same source.

\subsection{Preparing for multiple services}

Using the same bulletin source with if-statements to output only relevant
content for each service.

\subsection{Multiple print editions}
\index{Arara}

Have your cake and eat it too. Or, 'the two bulletin church' rather that the
'two service church'.

\section{Out-takes}

Because more sections are good right?

\subsection{Gallery}

Some inspiring examples of well typeset bulletins!
